<h1 align="center">Vetner360-Backend</h1>
<p> 
   This is my backend written in Golang, using the Chi router package to handle 
   and manage APIs easily. I also use Socket.IO for a real-time chat system to 
   handle messages between doctors and pet owners. This backend handles requests 
   from the mobile app and dashboard, which are written in Flutter and Next.js. 
   I've structured the code in an MVC pattern to manage it easily and make it 
   scalable. For the database, I use MongoDB and the MongoDB Golang Driver. 
   Each API is thoroughly validated and written in an easily understandable way.
   It was created for my FYP project.
   Below are the instructions on how to run the backend:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>git clone git@github.com:sameershahid1/vetner360-backend.git</li>
  <li>go mod download</li>
  <li>go run .</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these instructions you can start the clone and start the server.</p>
<p>Please follow me because I will be creating projects in Golang from time to time.</p>
